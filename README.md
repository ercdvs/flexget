# [Flexget](http://www.flexget.com) Configuration Files

Original credit for much of this config goes to [Jeff Wilson](mailto:jeff@jeffalwilson.com)

This should always be the latest iteration of my Flexget config, when i remember to commit changes.

The [secrets](http://flexget.com/wiki/Plugins/secrets) plugin is used to contain all my specific logins to the services I am using.  You will have to create a secret.yml in the same directory as your config.yml for this to work.
